ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mlsmourao!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, Python, and learning new tech skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Python, Streamlit, and dipping my toes into TypeScript.

ðŸ’¬ I'm open to collaborating on beginner-friendly projects or contributing to open-source projects.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at marialuizasm.97@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn https://br.linkedin.com/in/maria-luiza-silva-mour%C3%A3o.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you might catch me rewatching Sakura Card Captors and imagining what my own magical cards would do!

Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if you want to collaborate or chat! ðŸš€
